# 2D Maze Platformer
This program is a 2D platformer game built using Python and the pygame library.

## Skills Developed
While working on this project, I learned how to:

 - Use pygame classes and functions to create a game loop and handle user input
 - Create and use pixel art sprites in the game
 - Perform animations using sprrites
 - Implement gravity and collision detection in the game

## Running the Program
To run the program, you will need to have Python and pygame installed on your computer. You can then clone this repository and run the following command from the root directory:

`python main.py`

This will start the game and you can use the arrow keys to move the character and the space bar to jump. Have fun!
